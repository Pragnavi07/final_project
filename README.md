# Automated Waste Classification using Deep Learning

This repository contains a Python script for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify waste images as either "Organic" or "Recyclable."  This project aims to automate waste sorting, improving efficiency and reducing the negative impacts associated with manual methods.

## Overview

The code utilizes TensorFlow/Keras to build and train the CNN model.  It includes data loading, preprocessing, augmentation, model definition, training, evaluation, and prediction functionalities.  The dataset used for training is obtained from Kaggle.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Glob
- Tqdm
- KaggleHub

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python glob tqdm kagglehub
Usage
Dataset Download: The script automatically downloads the waste classification dataset from Kaggle using kagglehub.

Running the script:

Bash

python your_script_name.py  # Replace your_script_name.py with the actual filename
Code Structure:
your_script_name.py: Contains the main code for data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training, evaluation, and prediction.
Data: The dataset is expected to be structured as provided by the Kaggle source, with separate "TRAIN" and "TEST" directories, each containing subdirectories for "O" (Organic) and "R" (Recyclable) waste.

Model: The CNN architecture consists of convolutional layers, max pooling, dropout, flatten, and dense layers. The model is compiled using Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

Training: The model is trained using ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation and flow_from_directory to load data from the directories.

Evaluation: Training and validation accuracy/loss are plotted after training. The predict_fun function demonstrates how to use the trained model to classify new images.

Key Improvements and Considerations
Data Augmentation: ImageDataGenerator is used to augment the training data, improving model generalization.
Clearer File Paths: The code constructs file paths using os.path.join for better cross-platform compatibility.
Visualization: Matplotlib is used to visualize the class distribution and training progress.
Kaggle Integration: kagglehub simplifies dataset download.
Further Improvements:
Explore different CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet).
Implement more advanced data augmentation techniques.
Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Evaluate on a more diverse and larger dataset if available.
Implement more robust evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score).
Consider deploying the model for real-time classification.
Example Prediction
The predict_fun function demonstrates how to classify a new image:

Python

test_img = cv2.imread('/path/to/your/image.jpg') # Replace with your image path
predict_fun(test_img)
This will print the predicted class (Organic or Recyclable) and display the image.  Remember to replace /path/to/your/image.jpg with the actual path to your image file.
